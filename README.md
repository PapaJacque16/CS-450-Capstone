### Machine Learning Model with findings using COLAB, Python, and HTML/CSS.
Steps to create this project:

1. Determine the problem you are solving with the app - this will guide the type of machine learning algorithm you use
2. Choose and gather the appropriate data for the model
3. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for model training
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Choose and develop the appropriate machine learning model using JavaScript
6. Train the model on the training data
7. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data
8. Fine-tune the model by adjusting parameters and retraining on the training data
9. Integrate the model into the HTML/CSS page
10. Test the entire app for functionality and accuracy, and make any necessary adjustments, before commiting final publishment of findings on HTML page.
